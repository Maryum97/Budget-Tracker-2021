## 🔍 Description
This repository contains the homework assignment conducted through the teaching facilities of the Univesity of Birmingham, in the third phase of the Coding Bootcamp; a web application by the name "Budget Tracker". This web application is very useful to people who wish to keep track of their spendings and earnings, so that they may handle their finances more wisely.

Users are also able to utilise this app on their device anywhere they may be, because of how accessible this app has been made as the sole purpose of this assignment - this app is a PWA (Progressive Web Application). In other words, this app enables users to enjoy its features offline, just as well as it does online.

The app allows a user to enter the name and amount of a transaction into the account on the main page. On pressing the "+ Add Funds" and "- Subtract Funds" buttons, the amount of money is added and subtracted from the user's total amount respectively. The total amount is then displayed on the top of the page, and the added/subtracted transactions are represented in the form of an area graph on the same page.

This app is deployed on <b>Heroku</b> and is linked below:

The application is connected with <b>Atlas</b>, where all the entries are stored, and may be added, edited or deleted from.

In order to install the app, you can simply gain access to this repository and clone it after having installed the following applications on your local device:

1. VS Code
2. Git Bash/Terminal
3. Robo3T
4. Node.js

## ⚙️ Instructions
After installing the above, run the following commands in the local terminal in VS Code:

## ✏️ Tests
There were no particular test that this app has been made to pass, except for the app to flow error-free in the local terminal and in the browser, with all the correct packages and libraries installed, the Heroku app connected to the Atlas account (if running publically), and the server running at all times of use.
